React Native wrapper for Android's SMS User Consent API, ready to use in React Native components with minimum effort.

# Getting started

Will be available after uploading to NPM.

# Basic usage

First of all, we should start the SMS receive process with `startSmsHandling` so that native part knows that it should handle SMS-messages and show the consent system modal to the user when the SMS is received. In order to stop handling SMS-messages we call `stopSmsHandling`. The common case to use it is when the Two-factor auth component is unmounted.

Also, we should call `addSmsListener` with a callback in order to receive the actual SMS and use it in our app. `addSmsListener` method returns the `removeSmsListener` method that should be called whenever we want to stop receiving SMS-messages in our component.

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text } from 'react-native';

import { startSmsHandling, stopSmsHandling, addSmsListener } from 'react-native-sms-user-consent';

function MyComponent() {
  const [sms, setSms] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    startSmsHandling();
    return () => {
      stopSmsHandling();
    };
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    const removeSmsListener = addSmsListener((event) => {
      const receivedSms = event?.sms;
      if (!receivedSms) {
        console.warn('No SMS received!');
        return;
      }
      setSms(receivedSms);
    });
    return removeSmsListener;
  }, []);

  return <Text>SMS text: {sms}</Text>;
}
```

## Methods

### startSmsHandling

```typescript
type Event = {
  sms?: string;
}

startSmsHandling(onSmsReceived: (event: Event) => void): (
  stopSmsHandling(): void
)
```

Starts the native SMS listener that will show the SMS User Consent system prompt. If the user has allowed reading the SMS, then the `onSmsReceived` callback is called. `onSmsReceived` receives the event object containing the SMS.

Returns `stopSmsHandling` function that stops showing the system prompt and stops SMS handling.

### retrieveVerificationCode

```typescript
retrieveVerificationCode(sms: string, codeLength: number = 6): string | null
```

Retrieves the verification code from an SMS if there is any.
