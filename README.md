# React Native SMS User Consent

React Native wrapper for Android's SMS User Consent API, ready to use in React Native components with minimum effort.

## iOS

SMS User Consent API exists only on Android, so this package is Android-only. Calling the APIs on iOS is no-op.

If you want auto-filling on iOS, `textContentType="oneTimeCode"` for `TextInput` is the way to go. Basically, this is the only way for iOS

## Getting started

```
yarn add @eabdullazyanov/react-native-sms-user-consent
```

or

```
npm install @eabdullazyanov/react-native-sms-user-consent
```

## Basic usage

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { TextInput } from 'react-native';

import { useSmsUserConsent } from '@eabdullazyanov/react-native-sms-user-consent';

const Example = () => {
  const [code, setCode] = useState();

  const retrievedCode = useSmsUserConsent();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (retrievedCode) setCode(retrievedCode);
  }, [retrievedCode]);

  return <TextInput value={code} onChangeText={setCode} />;
}
```

In the example we use a controlled `TextInput` for the code entry. `sms` equals to the empty string initially, and whenever an SMS is handled `sms` receives its content. We use the `useEffect` to update the value when an SMS is handled. Inside the effect we use the `retrieveVerificationCode` method to retrieve the code from the SMS and update the input value with it.

## API

### useSmsUserConsent()

```typescript
useSmsUserConsent(codeLength = 6): string
```

React hook that starts SMS handling and provides the handled SMS as its return value, which is the empty string initially. Stops handling SMS messages on unmount. Uses `startSmsHandling` and `retrieveVerificationCode` internally.

This hook is the way to go in most cases. Alternatively, you can use `startSmsHandling` and `retrieveVerificationCode` directly if dealing with something that is not a functional component or you need some more flexibility.

On iOS it just returns the empty string, so no additional code to handle iOS is needed.

### startSmsHandling()

```typescript
type Event = {
  sms?: string;
}

startSmsHandling(onSmsReceived: (event: {sms?: string}) => void): (
  stopSmsHandling(): void
)
```

Starts the native SMS listener that will show the SMS User Consent system prompt. If the user has allowed reading the SMS, then the `onSmsReceived` callback is called. `onSmsReceived` receives the event object containing the SMS.

Returns `stopSmsHandling` function that stops showing the system prompt and stops SMS handling.

### retrieveVerificationCode()

```typescript
retrieveVerificationCode(sms: string, codeLength: number = 6): string | null
```

Retrieves the verification code from an SMS if there is any.

*You can import the whole API as one object if you prefer*

```javascript
import SmsUserConsent from 'react-native-sms-user-consent';

// ...
SmsUserConsent.useSmsUserConsent();
// ...
```
